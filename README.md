# My Health Records

  My Health Records is an application which enables everyday people to manage their own health records. Built on top of EHRbase (an implementation of the openEHR standard for Electronic Health Records), My Health Records allows users to upload, view and quickly share their health records with Medical professionals; all from a convenient web interface.
